# Guarrera-story
a great story about Guarrera
Once upon a foggy somber morning there was a man
He had left his house extra early as to arrive early at school so he could study for an exam
He was craving coffee, so he left for the lunch counter for an early morning coffee. 
However, there was not a soul there.
Panicking, he soon realized that it was Saturday.
